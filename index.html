                    <p>Hi, I'm Jan Hassan, a BSECE graduate. I'm a former Networks Field Engineer specializing in 
                        Routing and Switching. I've found my passion as a Java Developer with focus on backend development. That doesn't stop me from knowing 
                        a little frontend HTML, CSS, and Javascript though ðŸ˜Š. I've been developing projects on my own for almost two years now, 
                        focusing on Springboot, JPA, Hibernate, Rest API and mySQL as the database. Feel free to browse through them on the "projects" section :)</p>
